## [2.0.2] - Release ðŸš€

### Fixed

- Resolved an issue where `onCountryChanged` was not being invoked correctly.
- Fixed an issue where `initialCountryCode` was not setting the input length properly on initialization.

## [2.0.1] - Release

#### Newly Added

- New Add translations for **`Portuguese`** languages.

#### Changed

- We have removed the `prefixIcon` from `IntlMobileField`. Now, users have to pass all attributes for `FlagsDropDown` directly in `IntlMobileField`.

#### Improved

- Now the length will not be stuck at 10 digits for all countries.
- Now able to make the field optional.
- Now `initialValue` will change the default country flag.

#### Notes

- The user can still use `FlagsDropDown` separately anywhere.

## [2.0.0] - Release

#### Newly Added

- **`FlagImage` widget** - Easily display any country's flag anywhere in your UI.
- **`FlagsDropDown` widget** - A fully customizable country selector with dialog support.
- Support for **custom validation** - Pass a custom `validator` function with both sync and async validation handling.
- Users can now add `prefixIcon` and `suffixIcon` in `IntlMobileField`.
- `FlagsDropDown` appears in the `prefixIcon` by default for `IntlMobileField`, but can be overridden.

#### Changed

- Updated **phone number length validation** for **Seychelles** to match accurate formatting rules.

#### Improved

- Introduced **debounced async validation** to prevent overlapping validator calls and improve performance.
- Developers can **fully customize or replace** the flag dropdown by injecting their own `FlagsDropDown`.
- Added configuration options to **hide flags, country codes**, or **dropdown icons** both in the field and dialog.

#### Notes

- Flutter's native `validator` is not async, so **async validation is handled internally** via `onChanged`, with a debounce.
- For real-time validation feedback, use the `onChanged` callback and manage UI state accordingly.
- Explore the package for knowing what new in it.
